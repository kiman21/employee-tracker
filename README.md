# employee-tracker

## Description
In this project I built a command line interface or CMS using Node.js, Inquirer npm package, and MYSQL for the database for the purpose of managing an employee database.

## Installation
Run `npm i` to install all dependencies.

## Usage
After running `npm i`, go into mysql in the command terminal and sign in with `-uroot -ppassword`. Run `SOURCE db/schema.sql' before exiting mysql. Then run `node index.js` to start the inquirer prompts. Use the initial options to choose to view departments, roles, and employees or add a new department, role, or employee as well as updating roles for an existing employee.
